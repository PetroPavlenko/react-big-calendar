In the case\n * of displaying events on whole days, end dates are rounded _up_ to the next day. So an\n * event ending on `Apr 8th 12:00:00 am` will not appear on the 8th, whereas one ending\n * on `Apr 8th 12:01:00 am` will. If you want _inclusive_ ranges consider providing a\n * function `endAccessor` that returns the end date + 1 day for those events that end at midnight.\n */\nclass Calendar extends React.Component {\n static propTypes = {\n\n   /**\n    * Props passed to main calendar `<div>`.\n    */\n   elementProps: PropTypes.object,\n\n   /**\n    * The current date value of the calendar.

A move can be made to one of the parent's siblings, if\n * that sibling is also a parent to the child group. This will make room for\n * more events.\n *\n * When a child group knows its parent, it looks at the space occupied by that\n * parent, and calculates the remaning available space and divides that among\n * each other.\n *\n * All widths and x-offsets are calculated without taking overlapping into\n * account. Overlapping is added in the end according to the OVERLAP_MULTIPLIER.\n * If that is set to 0, the events won't overlap or grow.\n *\n * When one of these rounds are finished, all events connected have been\n * traversed, so the cursor will be moved past all of them.\n */\nexport default function getStyledEvents ({\n  events: unsortedEvents, startAccessor, endAccessor, min, totalMin, step\n}) {\n  let OVERLAP_MULTIPLIER = 0.3\n  let events = sort(unsortedEvents, { startAccessor, endAccessor })\n  let helperArgs = { events, startAccessor, endAccessor, min, totalMin, step }\n  let styledEvents = []\n  let idx = 0\n\n  // One iteration will cover all connected events.\n  while (idx < events.length) {\n    let siblings = getSiblings(idx, helperArgs)\n    let { childGroups, nbrOfChildColumns } = getChildGroups(\n      idx, idx + siblings.length + 1, helperArgs\n    )\n    let nbrOfColumns = Math.max(nbrOfChildColumns, siblings.length) + 1;\n    console.log(nbrOfColumns);\n    // Set styles to top level events.\n    [idx, ...siblings].forEach((eventIdx, siblingIdx) => {\n      let event = events[eventIdx]\n      let style = {};\n      let {top, height} = getYStyles(eventIdx, helperArgs)\n      let width = 100 / nbrOfColumns\n      if (event.background) {\n        style = {\n          top,\n          height,\n          width: 100,\n          xOffset: 0\n        };\n        styledEvents[eventIdx] = {\n          event,\n          style\n        }\n      }\n      else {\n        let xAdjustment = width * (nbrOfColumns > 1 ?
